/*
 * A very thin wrapper around winston for general server logging.
 * Exports a winston Logger instance in exports.logger with several functions
 * corresponding to different log levels.  use it like this:
 *
 *     const logger = require('../libs/logging.js').logger;
 *     logger.debug("you can probably ignore this.  just for debugging.");
 *     logger.info("something happened, here's info about it!");
 *     logger.warn("this isn't good.  it's not a fatal error, but needs attention");
 *     logger.error("this isn't good at all.  I will probably crash soon.");
 *
 * All log messages from all types of logging are put over the Winston pipe.
 * Transports listen on the Winston pipe for messages that are of interest to
 * them, and take appropriate action. This occurs for file logging,
 * metrics logging, KPI logging, and statsd.
 *
 * CEF is slightly different, all CEF messages are sent over the pipe but
 * the cef interface takes care of writing to cef directly.
